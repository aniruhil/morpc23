### From the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) ... 

&gt; The R language is an open source environment for statistical computing and graphics, and runs on a wide variety of computing platforms. The R language has enjoyed significant growth, and now supports over 2 million users. A broad range of industries have adopted the R language, including biotech, finance, research and high technology industries. The R language is often integrated into third party analysis, visualization and reporting applications. 

### The core of R is the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) 

&gt; R is a GNU implementation of the S language and environment (developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues). ... For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly. 

&gt; R comes with `\(\textbf{8}\)` core packages, and there are a total of `\(\textbf{19,204}\)` contributed packages on [CRAN -- the Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)
